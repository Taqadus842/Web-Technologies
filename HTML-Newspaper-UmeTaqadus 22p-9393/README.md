## Project Description
This project recreates the front page of Nawa-i-Pakistan newspaper (1978) using HTML only. 
The layout includes multiple columns, headlines, articles, and images to match the original newspaper style.

## Features Implemented
- 4-column layout using semantic HTML5 tags
- `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>` used
- 3+ images included (masthead and article photos)
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Inline styles for colors, borders, and alignment
- Comments explaining each section

## Challenges Faced
Structuring multiple columns without CSS files was challenging. Using `<section>` and `<article>` tags helped maintain semantic structure while keeping proper alignment.
